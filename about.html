  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>Since the first iPhone in 2007, we’ve been in the iPhone business.</p>
  <p>We even still have an iPhone 1 on hand and photos of the iPhone 3Gs shipment from 2009.</p>

  <div class="stock-section">
    <img src="images/stock-sample.jpg" alt="Pre-owned iPhone stock">
    <p>Ready stock for global shipment</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the early days of the iPhone, all markets were focused on new iPhones. At that time, Steve Jobs humbly said that he hoped the iPhone could achieve just 1% market share someday. Later, we all witnessed the incredible success of the iPhone.</p>

  <p>Today, iPhones help us in many ways every day, and pre-owned iPhones can reach even more people. The pre-owned iPhone market is booming, and we look forward to cooperating with long-term partners to create win–win opportunities that benefit people and the environment. Together, we are excited to achieve great success!</p>
